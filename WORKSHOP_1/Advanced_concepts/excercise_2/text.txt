Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose portions of a file to add to the next commit. 
This will present you with a chunk of changes and prompt you for a command. 
Use y to stage the chunk, n to ignore the chunk, s to split it into smaller chunks, e to manually edit the chunk, 
and q to exit.
